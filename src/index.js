// TO DO:

/* 1. Create a Ship class.
- Include their length, the number of times they’ve been hit and whether or not they’ve been sunk.
- Ships should have a hit() function that increases the number of ‘hits’ in your ship.
- isSunk() should be a function that calculates whether a ship is considered sunk based on its length and the number of hits it has received. */

/* 2. Create a Gameboard class.
- Gameboards should be able to place ships at specific coordinates by calling the ship class.
- Gameboards should have a receiveAttack function that takes a pair of coordinates, determines whether or not the attack hit a ship and then sends the ‘hit’ function to the correct ship, or records the coordinates of the missed shot.
- Gameboards should keep track of missed attacks so they can display them properly. */

/* 3. Create a Player class.
- There will be two types of players in the game, ‘real’ players and ‘computer’ players. */

/* 4. Import your classes into another file, and drive the game using event listeners to interact with your objects. Create a module that helps you manage actions that should happen in the DOM.
- At this point it is appropriate to begin crafting your User Interface.
- Set up a new game by creating Players */

/* 5. Finish it up by implementing a system that allows players to place their ships. For example, you can let them type coordinates for each ship or have a button to cycle through random placements. */
