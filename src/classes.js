/* 1. Create a Ship class.
- Include their length, the number of times they’ve been hit and whether or not they’ve been sunk.
- Ships should have a hit() function that increases the number of ‘hits’ in your ship.
- isSunk() should be a function that calculates whether a ship is considered sunk based on its length and the number of hits it has received. */
